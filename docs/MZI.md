# Mach-Zehnder Interferometer

After setting up the virtual environment, installing gdsfactory and other dependencies (or requirements.txt), setting up VSCode with jupyter, and going through the GDS Factory tutorial, I now aim to fully study a Mech-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) using GDSFactory. 

Once Tidy3D is needed (e.g. to simulated diferent geometries), I will go back to the tutorial.

## 1.0 | Geometry

GDSFactory uses objects (python Classes) called components (Class Component) to build geometries.

> A `Component` is like an empty canvas, in which you can add polygons, references to other Components and ports (to connect to other components) [GDSFactory].
