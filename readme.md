# Phtonic Integrated Ciruit Simulations (PICsim)
This project involves the compiling of physics equation solvers (usually in the form of boundary value PDEs or Integro-Differential equations). 

## PIC Component Simulation
One part of the project is to use the GDS Factory software toolkit to practice making design choices in concerteration of common problems in the feild of photonic integrated circuits.
* materials
* circuit geometry
* component design
* multi componenet integration

Simulations on GDSFactory files are most conviniently done with Tidy3D open-source software. Motivating problems include:
* calculating component (waveguide) cross-talk
* calculating propogation loss
* calculating component efficiency (couplers, interferometers)

#### Problem: Calculate what a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer does and how well it does it. 
> Step 1: create a MZI geometry in gds factory
Step 2: Upload to Tidy3d as a gds file.
Step 3:
